###Description
###Base Mode

Created a carousel that shows a person's GitHub, name, and their shoutout. Also has 'prev' and 'next' buttons to cycle through the people.

###Hard Mode

Added fadeIn & fadeOut effects.

###Pro Mode

Added a timer and setInterval function that switches to the next person every 10 seconds if no buttons are clicked.
